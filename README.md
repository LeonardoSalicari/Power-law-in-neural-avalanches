# Power-law statistics in Neural Avalanches

Code for the final project of the Quantitative Life Science course I have followed at University of Padua during the academic year 2019/2020.
The project's name is "Power-law statistics adn universal scaling in the absence of criticality", based on the [work from J. Touboul and A. Destexhe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08033).
The presentation `Presentation_avalanches.pdf` containes a brief introduction to the project together with the results obtained.

For the power-law analysis, the package used is the one described in the [work by M. Gerlach and E.G. Altmann](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11624).
