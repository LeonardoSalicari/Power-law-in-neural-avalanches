# Power-law statistics in Neural Avalanches

Cod for the final project of the Quantitative Life Science course I have followed at University of Padua during the academic year 2019/2020.
The project's name is "Power-law statistics adn universal scaling in the absence of criticality", based on the work from J. Touboul and A. Destexhe which has the same title. I can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08033).
The presentation `Presentation_avalanches.pdf` containes a brief introduction to the project together with the results obtained.

For the power-law analysis the package described and provieded in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11624) work by M. Gerlach and E.G. Altmann was used.
